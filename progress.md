# Progress Ledger

## 2026-06-21T16:42:34Z — Session start

- Current objective: implement the autonomous-crew alpha scope from `docs/implementation-approach-autonomous-crew.md`, beginning with Rust broker foundations that respect `docs/arch.md` and `docs/initial-impl.md`.
- Source docs read: `docs/implementation-approach-autonomous-crew.md`, `docs/arch.md`, `docs/initial-impl.md`, `docs/bubblewrap-fork.md`.
- Current state: workspace contains `foxprox-core` only, with a minimal crate marker and no alpha broker model yet.
- Verification plan for first commit boundary: add platform-independent core/policy/audit/config types with unit tests; run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace`.
- Expected commit boundary: coherent foundation commit for normalized events, audit schema, policy decisions/rules, config defaults, and fail-closed packet classification types in `foxprox-core`.
- Subagents/reviews requested: none yet.
- Commands run and outcomes: `git status --short --branch` showed clean `autonomous-crew`; source docs and initial crate files read successfully.
- Files changed: `progress.md` created.
- Current git status summary: clean before ledger creation.
- Next exact action: implement core foundation modules in `crates/foxprox-core` and add tests.

## 2026-06-21T16:54:22Z — Core foundation implemented and reviewed

- Current objective: finish and commit the first platform-independent `foxprox-core` foundation before moving to Milestone 0/1 TUN setup proof.
- Changes implemented:
  - Added normalized event model in `crates/foxprox-core/src/event.rs` for TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS CONNECT, TLS ClientHello, SOCKS CONNECT, ICMP, setup/session, and unsupported fail-closed events.
  - Added flow keys and UDP timeout classes in `crates/foxprox-core/src/flow.rs`.
  - Added deterministic policy model in `crates/foxprox-core/src/policy.rs` with default deny, direct DNS bypass guard, multicast/broadcast guard, TLS SNI/DNS mismatch and hidden-SNI guards, IP/CIDR/port/hostname/domain rules, and fail-closed unsupported handling.
  - Added structured audit schema in `crates/foxprox-core/src/audit.rs` with policy decision, endpoint, attribution, byte count, flow duration, and HTTP metadata fields.
  - Added platform-independent config data in `crates/foxprox-core/src/config.rs` for TUN, DNS, proxy env, UDP timeouts, policy, and audit defaults.
  - Kept `foxprox-core` dependency-free and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`/`#![deny(missing_docs)]`.
- Subagents/reviews requested:
  - `context-builder` wrote `context-build/core-foundation.md`; key recommendation was a no-dependency core foundation with normalized events, policy, audit, config, and flow types before Linux/TUN work.
  - Rust correctness reviewer found required fixes: semantic HTTP/SOCKS port matching, direct DNS bypass too narrow, audit missing HTTP metadata, contradictory SOCKS port representation.
  - Architecture reviewer found required fixes: direct DNS bypass too narrow, directed broadcast configuration gap, TLS mismatch/hidden-SNI not enforced, invalid port ranges accepted.
- Accepted findings and fixes:
  - Accepted HTTP/SOCKS port matching: added event port extraction independent of IP endpoint and added regression tests.
  - Accepted SOCKS contradiction risk: replaced separate SOCKS host/destination/port fields with `SocksDestination` enum.
  - Accepted direct DNS bypass issue: TCP/UDP destination port 53 now requires broker DNS before allow rules, regardless of UDP classification; regression test covers broad UDP allow.
  - Accepted audit HTTP metadata issue: added structured `origin`, `http_method`, and `path_and_query` audit fields and builder.
  - Accepted directed broadcast issue: policy now has configured broadcast addresses; default broker config adds the default TUN `/24` directed broadcast.
  - Accepted TLS mismatch/hidden-SNI issue: added default guards and tests; hidden SNI requires explicit IP/CIDR allow.
  - Accepted invalid port range issue: `PortRange::new` is now fallible; `PortRange::single` remains infallible.
- Rejected/deferred findings: no rejected reviewer findings for this commit; concrete egress traits are deferred to a later commit because first boundary is core schema/policy only.
- Verification commands and outcomes:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passed.
  - `cargo check --workspace` passed.
  - `cargo test --workspace` passed: 22 tests.
  - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed after replacing Rust 1.82-only `Option::is_none_or` with `map_or` for MSRV 1.80 compatibility.
  - `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` passed.
  - `cargo tree -p foxprox-core` showed `foxprox-core` only, confirming no new dependencies.
- Files changed: `crates/foxprox-core/src/lib.rs`, new `audit.rs`, `config.rs`, `event.rs`, `flow.rs`, `policy.rs`, `progress.md`, `learnings.md`.
- Current git status summary: modified `crates/foxprox-core/src/lib.rs`; new core module files and ledgers; temporary subagent artifact dirs still untracked pending cleanup/summarization.
- Next exact action: read final blocker review, apply any required fix, re-run verification, remove transient subagent artifact directories from the worktree, then commit the verified core foundation.

## 2026-06-21T16:58:18Z — Final core blocker fixed

- Current objective: commit verified `foxprox-core` foundation.
- Final blocker review: `core-final-blockers` found one required fix: TLS SNI/DNS mismatch was represented by a caller-supplied boolean and could be bypassed by inconsistent event construction.
- Accepted finding and fix: policy now derives mismatch from `sni` and `dns_hostname` inside core policy, treating the caller boolean only as additional evidence; added regression `tls_mismatch_is_derived_even_if_caller_flag_is_false`.
- Verification commands and outcomes after final fix:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passed.
  - `cargo check --workspace` passed.
  - `cargo test --workspace` passed: 23 tests.
  - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
  - `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` passed.
  - `cargo tree -p foxprox-core` showed only `foxprox-core`.
- Environment prerequisites checked for next milestone: `/dev/net/tun` exists, `bwrap` is `/usr/bin/bwrap`, and unprivileged user namespaces are enabled (`/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` = `1`).
- Files changed: core module files plus `progress.md` and `learnings.md`.
- Current git status summary: source and ledgers changed; subagent artifact directories removed from worktree.
- Next exact action: commit core foundation, then start Milestone 0/1 TUN setup and ICMP write-back proof using one writer thread.

## 2026-06-21T16:59:10Z — Core foundation committed; next objective selected

- Commit created: `1dcd576` (`add core broker foundation`).
- Current objective: start Milestone 1-safe packet proof code before wiring Linux setup: implement dependency-free IPv4/ICMPv4 parsing and synthetic echo-reply generation in a new device/packet crate.
- Rationale: this advances Packet Write-Back Proof mechanics while keeping Linux TUN/bwrap setup separate and preserving the core crate boundary.
- Verification plan: add focused unit tests for valid echo request reply, checksum correctness, unsupported fragmentation/protocol/type drops, and malformed packet rejection; run full workspace fmt/check/test/clippy/doc.
- Expected commit boundary: `foxprox-device` packet proof library plus progress update.
- Next exact action: add `crates/foxprox-device` and implement ICMPv4 echo reply synthesis without adding dependencies to `foxprox-core`.

## 2026-06-21T17:04:49Z — Device packet proof verified

- Current objective: commit dependency-free `foxprox-device` IPv4/ICMPv4 packet proof helpers.
- Changes implemented:
  - Added workspace crate `crates/foxprox-device` depending only on `foxprox-core`.
  - Added fail-closed IPv4 packet metadata parsing with validation for version, IHL, total length, unsupported options, unsupported fragmentation, and IPv4 header checksum.
  - Added ICMPv4 metadata parsing and echo-reply synthesis for valid echo requests addressed to the configured broker/gateway IP.
  - Echo replies swap IPv4 source/destination, set TTL, preserve identifier/sequence/payload, and recompute IPv4 and ICMP checksums.
  - Added conversion helpers from packet drop reasons to normalized `NetworkEvent::Unsupported` and ICMP messages to `NetworkEvent::IcmpMessage`.
- Subagents/reviews requested:
  - `device-packet-proof-blockers` reviewer found one blocker: incoming ICMPv4 checksums were not validated before reply synthesis.
- Accepted finding and fix:
  - Added `PacketDropReason::InvalidIcmpv4Checksum`, fail-closed checksum validation before echo reply synthesis, and regression test `drops_invalid_icmp_checksum`.
- Verification commands and outcomes:
  - `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passed.
  - `cargo check --workspace` passed.
  - `cargo test --workspace` passed: 23 core tests and 8 device tests.
  - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
  - `RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` passed.
  - `cargo tree -p foxprox-core` still showed only `foxprox-core`, confirming no dependency creep into core.
- Files changed: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `crates/foxprox-device/Cargo.toml`, `crates/foxprox-device/src/lib.rs`, `progress.md`.
- Current git status summary: uncommitted packet proof crate and progress update; review artifacts removed.
- Next exact action: commit packet proof, then start Linux setup/broker proof crates to create/configure TUN and write synthesized ICMP replies through an actual fd.
